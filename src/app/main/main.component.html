      <b>Purpose:</b> Deep cleaning is a more thorough and intensive cleaning

      not be addressed in regular cleaning sessions.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Tasks:</b> It involves cleaning tasks that go beyond the routine, such
      as scrubbing tiles and grout, cleaning inside appliances (like ovens and
      refrigerators), washing baseboards, cleaning light fixtures, and removing
      dust and cobwebs from corners and high surfaces.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Frequency:</b> It is typically done less frequently than regular
      cleaning and is often performed on a seasonal basis or as needed to
      maintain a higher level of cleanliness.
